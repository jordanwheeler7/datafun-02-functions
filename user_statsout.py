=============================================================

Here's some weight data: [105, 129, 87, 86, 111, 111, 89, 81, 108, 92, 110, 100, 75, 105, 103, 109, 76, 119, 99, 91, 103, 129, 106, 101, 84, 111, 74, 87, 86, 103, 103, 106, 86, 111, 75, 87, 102, 121, 111, 88, 89, 101, 106, 95, 103, 107, 101, 81, 109, 104]

Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendancy:
   mean=99.12
   median=102.50
   mode=111.00

Descriptive statistics include measures of spread:
   var=179.25
   stddev=13.39


=============================================================

See the following for weight and rep data:

xtimes:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

yvalues:[405, 385, 365, 315, 295, 275, 225, 225, 205, 185, 185, 135]

These stats will show the correlation between the reps and weight

   correlation between xreps and xreps = 1.00
   correlation between xtimes and yvalues = -0.99



Now we will see some of our data combined.

x (reps):[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

y (pounds):[405, 385, 365, 315, 295, 275, 225, 225, 205, 185, 185, 135]

We will calculate for the best fit straight line:

   slope = -23.92
   intercept = 422.12

Now we will predict our future weight using the best fit line:

   At 14, reps,
   your predicted weight will be 87.
